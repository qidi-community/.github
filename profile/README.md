## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a community of hackers and modders not employed by QIDI Tech. We like to improve our printers, and we like to publish what we do so others can follow us in our footsteps. 

Everyone is welcome to contribute, and we accept Pull Requests on all of our projects. You can read more about how this is done in [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Our core ethos is: 

- Keep compatibility with stock slicer profiles if possible. This reduces the amount of issues for users.
- Avoid conflicting documentation at all costs.
- Respect user idiocy. If the user wants to do something dangerous, let them, but have them know it's idiotic/dangerous.
- Assume the user has not touched a shell when it comes to linux. Reduce the need for terminal knowledge through scripts, output helpful error messages in said scripts.
- Your projects remain yours. The organization does not own anything. Org members maintaining the projects do.
- Transparency and visibility. A submission should be easily tracked down to their author. (git blame, files signed off at the header, so on)
- We support inclusivity and do not condone any kind of hate speed or discrimination.

If you have issues about how this organization is ran, you can bring them up with the owners of the organization, that is @vega-d (msg@vega76.cz, discord: `vega_d`) and stew675 (discord: `stew675`). 
This document can and will change as our organization grows and evolves. But the edit history will always be visible [in the git commits log](https://github.com/qidi-community/.github/commits/main/).
